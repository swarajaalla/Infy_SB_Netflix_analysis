# About_dataset
The Netflix Movies & TV Shows dataset has about 8,800 titles with information like whether it's a movie or TV show, who directed it, who’s in it, which country it came from, its release year, when Netflix added it, its rating, how long it runs, and what genres it belongs to. Some pieces of information (like director or country) are missing in many records. Each title often has more than one genre. There’s no data about how many people watched or which countries the show is available in. Despite that, the dataset works well for studying trends over time (what kind of shows/movies are added when), looking at genre popularity, and grouping similar content.

# Achieved_through_netflixproject

By working with this dataset (after cleaning & feature engineering), we can:

--Chart how Netflix’s content library has grown over time (both in total number and by content type).

--Identify which genres are most dominant, which are growing or shrinking over years.

--Analyze production origins (countries) and see how geographic diversity changes.

--Derive features like duration categories, age of content, genre multi-labels, etc.

--Build models (clustering, classification) to group similar content or predict content type / originality.
